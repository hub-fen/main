<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks to innate restraint and receptivity, you can notice the most subtle connections between things. In practical terms, this ability makes you a prudent adventurer, but in an abstract respect, it allows you to accumulate a huge amount of knowledge. Since you also have psychic abilities, it is likely that you have a keen interest in metaphysical and spiritual issues.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; There is a certain duality in your character. On the one hand, you are quite open and even charming, and on the other, you are cold and prudent. Since you can manifest these qualities in surprisingly quick succession, many people consider you a mystery. However, loved ones are familiar with your kindness and friendliness firsthand. The best companion for you will be a person who appreciates and respects your multifaceted personality and an inquiring mindset.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Since you love order, do not clutter your home with furnishings so that you can easily get from one room to another. You need to have a special place for your personal account or library where your computer and other electronic equipment will stand.<br></p>

<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; In an adult, the characteristic features of star numbers are most evident in the Year of Birth Number, which is believed to determine personality by about 45 percent.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The number of the Month of Birth determines the person by about 30 percent, but these are very important percentages - the spiritual aspirations of a person.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The number of Month of Birth is the most important number for people who are not yet eighteen years old, and for those who are essentially "immature".

<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The number of the House of Birth represents the remaining 25 percent of the individual. It reflects the habits and inclinations of a person.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Most people have two or three different numbers in their birth code. However, there are people who have all three numbers on the map the same. For example, those who were born in the year and month of the five (say, between August 8 and September 7, 1995).<br></p>

It is often difficult for them to “stand on their feet,” but once they have achieved independence, they are rapidly progressing. They are smart, but can be overly changeable, which prevents them from focusing on important goals. Even put on the brink of survival, they always come out of the situation laughing. The Sevens are very sociable and like to talk on different topics - regardless of whether they know something about the subject or not. They do not like disputes and stressful situations, they always say what they want to hear from them, and not what they really think. They want to like, and it's hard for them to say no to anyone. Seven is the Yin number.<br></p>

<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; People born in the year of the White Eight are balanced and responsible. They love family traditions and need the love and support of their relatives.

However, the Eights achieve excellence in everything and love tasks that challenge their abilities. They always strive to get the big picture and do not like to dive into the details. They are usually reserved, but when they speak, they accurately express their thoughts. Honesty and straightforwardness give them trouble from time to time. The eights are persistent and stubborn. They are conservative in nature and do not like change. Outwardly they are calm, restrained in relation to others, but deep inside they are very sensitive. They are constantly developing throughout life, achieving maximum success in middle age. Very often they achieve financial success, although this is not always noticeable, since they do not advertise their wealth. Eight is the Yang number.<br></p>

<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; People born in the year of the Green Wood are practical, independent, thoughtful and ambitious. They are a constant source of fresh, new ideas, which makes them interesting to everyone around. The Quartet are advocates of justice and always actively express their position when confronted with a violation of individual freedom. However, they express their protest in a gracious tone, without causing insults. They are not very attentive to trifles, preferring a “global” view of things. Therefore, they need people to work who can take care of the details. Such personalities tend to put off a lot for later, and then catch up on what is delayed in an “emergency” mode, although it is extremely difficult for them to endure such stressful situations. Four is the Yin number.<br></p>
