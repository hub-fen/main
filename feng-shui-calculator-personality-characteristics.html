<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Strength, success and luck come through the continuous and effective development of oneself as a person. Participation in developing affairs and bringing development to current affairs is favorable and gives vitality. They give strength: green color in clothes and the surrounding interior, objects made of wood, fresh flowers, walks in the park or forest.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Intelligence - Fire
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Creative expression lies in the realm of emotions and information processing. To enhance creativity, it is necessary to fill life with art in all its manifestations. The energy of Creativity is: red in clothes and interior, the fire of a candle, fireplace or bonfire, sunny weather, relaxation in hot countries, images of birds and emotions.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Wealth - Earth
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Thoroughness, thoroughness and stability are the main conditions for obtaining wealth. Impulsiveness and haste are fraught with financial losses and poverty. It is favorable to engage in real estate and the "Land" in all its manifestations. The energy of wealth is carried: a yellow-brown gamut in clothes and interiors, stone and crystal products.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Power - Metal
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Technology is needed to control internal and external. Knowing how makes it possible to effectively manage yourself and others. A low-tech management approach leads to a loss of control over the situation. The authorities carry energy: white and metallic colors in clothes and interiors, metal weapons and armor, cars, computers and office equipment, metal objects and jewelry.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Resources - Water
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Getting Resources requires connections and contacts with as many people as possible. A thick notebook and ability to communicate is the main source of new opportunities. The energy of the Resources is: black and the whole blue-blue gamut of colors in clothes and interiors, glass objects, an aquarium, a fountain, a pool, a shower, open reservoirs and an ordinary glass of water.<br></p>

<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; FEATURES OF CHARACTER
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; You enjoy life, you are attracted to new adventures, unusual places and unexpected events. Your specific position attracts people, your enthusiasm and willpower help you easily win supporters. You do not always have the determination to look at yourself from the side, you do not like to “lose face”, you do not like when people see your failures; in this case, you are likely to take up a new business and start all over again.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Everything unpredictable attracts your attention, and if others may be careful, you are not afraid to look for the unknown in unusual situations. Usually you are not happy when you are told about something interesting, you need to experience it yourself. You are a generous nature, involving friends in your plans. In case of danger, you can retreat, but you can be aggressive when you are driven into a corner. As soon as the feeling of security returns to you, you gain confidence that allows you to set off again in a risky enterprise.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; You trust your instincts and usually follow them, although there is a logical side to your character, which allows you to carefully assess the situation at the same time. Sometimes you may get in trouble because you trust unreliable people too much or, on the contrary, treat others too critically and even suspiciously. If you have experienced disappointment, then you can pull yourself together and go on a new path.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Although your friends are impressed by your optimism, it is not easy for them to share your enthusiasm, and for those who are not able to perform extraordinary acts, you lose interest. You are a brave and generous friend, but if you do not achieve what you want, you can be stubborn and selfish. In your relationship with friends, ups and downs are inevitable, but deep down you remain a faithful friend.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; LOVE
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Your life energy goes to your relations with partners, and it is typical for you to leave one partner for another, being carried away by each of them. You are attracted to the fact that each connection is accompanied by a new rush of romance, but over time, when the feeling of novelty is lost and boredom comes, you rush to find a new partner. When love falls, you can get depressed for a short time, but very soon you will regain energy aimed at finding a new partner.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; You are attracted to people with an independent character: although your society may excite them and your energy will delight them, they can still do without you. More likely to succeed in relationships with those who share your adventurism, but pursue their own interests.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; You are not afraid to express your feelings and sincerely in your emotions, but you are inconsistent. You need a partner who is calm and faithful, but stealthily pursues his own goals.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; CAREER
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Optimism, determination and initiative are your strengths. You may be inspired by people or places, a random remark, or something unexpectedly seen, and then you will be enthusiastic. Some things that you take with excitement may succeed.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; However, you do not cope well with failures and are embarrassed when colleagues find that you have misjudged the situation.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; When making plans, you do not pay attention to trifles and avoid complicated preparation - you prefer to start work immediately and not create unnecessary fuss.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Your ability to grasp the essence and energy in the pursuit of your own will perfectly help you in your career. In the work you are mainly attracted by its interest and quality of execution, not profit.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; You will make a traveler, designer, politician, soldier, policeman, travel writer, researcher, advertiser or businessman.<br></p>

<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Being a creative person, you are passionate about your hobbies and are able to achieve great success in life. If you are seeking love and intimacy, you usually also succeed, except when your lover (or lover) does not like your dictatorial ways or ways of manifesting your passion. Worst of all, when a partner shows possessive feelings or begins to be jealous of you. When it seems to you that someone is threatening your freedom, you quickly lose patience and lose your temper. However, if your partner has a sense of humor and is able to smooth out your aggressive style of behavior, then your relationship will be joyful. In intimate life, you can show great ingenuity and show yourself from the most unexpected side.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Since you love the elevated setting, make your home a suitable place for fun and entertainment. Decorate it with warm shades of decor, beautiful furniture, carpets, artwork and flowers.<br></p>

<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Each number in the astrology system of the Nine Palaces is associated with a color, element, and one of the eight trigrams of Zhou and (I-ching), and can also be Yin or Yang (female or male) in nature.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; In an adult, the characteristic features of star numbers are most evident in the Year of Birth Number, which is believed to determine personality by about 45 percent.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The number of the Month of Birth determines the person by about 30 percent, but these are very important percentages - the spiritual aspirations of a person.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The number of Month of Birth is the most important number for people who are not yet eighteen years old, and for those who are essentially "immature".
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; It can also become the most important number when a person is under the influence of severe stress or under the pressure of adverse circumstances.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The number of the House of Birth represents the remaining 25 percent of the individual. It reflects the habits and inclinations of a person.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Most people have two or three different numbers in their birth code. However, there are people who have all three numbers on the map the same. For example, those who were born in the year and month of the five (say, between August 8 and September 7, 1995).<br></p>
